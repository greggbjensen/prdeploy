# prdeploy

GitHub App that allows the entire build-deploy lifecycle to happen within a feature branch.  If any problems are found in the deployment, a new commit is done and rolled through without needing multiple PRs.

## Deployment Practices

1. Each pull request should be deployed as ready in the CD workflow.
2. Only once deployed and verified the pull request should be merged to main.
3. This application is deployed to a kubernetes cluster using the helm chart.
