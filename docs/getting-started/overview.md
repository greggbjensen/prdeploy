Here is how to get started by configuring your GitHub organization with a GitHub App and a GitHub OAuth app. For notifications we will also setup a Slack App.

## Setup steps

1. [GitHub App](./1-github-app.md) - Webhooks for responding to GitHub events.
2. [GitHub OAuth App](./2-github-oauth-app.md) - Authentication for accessing deployment portal.
3. [Slack App](./3-slack-app.md) - Post notifications for deployments and releases.
4. [Jira Integration](./4-jira-integration.md) - Link JIRA issues from the branch name to your pull request description.
5. [AWS Configuration](./5-aws-configuration.md) - External secrets, save settings, and track deployment versions.
6. [prdeploy portal](./6-prdeploy-portal.md) - The web portal that allows you to manage settings and deployments.
7. [GitHub Actions](./7-github-actions.md) - A combined deploy that intuitively promotes services in a single workflow.
