Here is how to get started by configuring your GitHub organization with a GitHub App and a GitHub OAuth app. For notifications we will also setup a Slack App.

## Setup steps

1. [GitHub App](1-github-app.md) - Webhooks for responding to GitHub events.
2. [GitHub OAuth App](2-github-oauth-app.md) - Authentication for accessing deployment portal.
3. [Slack App](3-slack-app.md) - Post notifications for deployments and releases.
4. [Repo config](4-repo-config.md) - Configure your repository with environments and services.
5. [GitHub Actions](5-github-actions.md) - A combined deploy that intuitively promotes services in a single workflow.
